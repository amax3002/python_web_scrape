# Python Web Scraper

This is a basic Python web scraper for an assignment. The  [site](http://data-interview.enigmalabs.org/companies/)) being scraped for information is a company listings site containing ten pages of company links. Each link endpoint holds company-specific data such as name, description and address.

The code also puts the information into a JSON file called "solution.json".
